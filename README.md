# Delirio Binding of Isaac Mod

## Mod Description

Delirio Mod adds a new character : Delirio.

It comes with its own item : Delirio's Curse.

The character concept is all about his item. It is a 6 charges active item. When you have it, you can't remove it anymore and if you let it go to full charge it will damage you every room. When used, you will turn into one of the other characters. You need at least 2 charges to use it.

## Installation

Clone the project and put the folder in your mods folder (if you are using Steam: Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\mods)
