# Delirio Binding of Isaac Mod

## Mod Description

Delirio Mod adds a new character : Delirio.

It comes with its own item : Delirio's Curse.

The character concept is all about his item. It is a 6 charges active item. When you have it, you can't remove it anymore and if you let it go to full charge it will damage you every room. When used, you will turn into one of the other characters. You need at least 2 charges to use it.

## TODO-List:

### Bug fixes:

- Black hearts instead of soul hearts and vice versa (doesn't always occur)
- Handle multiplayer

### Item updates:

- Put the item behind unlock conditions.
- Add the Delirium's Coffee
- Randomize Eden when using item

### Character updates:

- Put the character behind unlock conditions.
- Make the tainted version.

### GFX:

- Resprite the item. (+ sprite for pause menu)
- Do the character sprites (resources-dlc3\gfx\characters\costumes\character_delirio.png + resources-dlc3\gfx\ui\stage\playerportrait_delirio.png).
- Change player costume when using item (+ gooey version of everyone).
- Everything that involves the tinted version.

### VFX & SFX:

- When the curse is used, put Delirium effects
