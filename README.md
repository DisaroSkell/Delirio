# Delirio Binding of Isaac Mod

## Mod Description

Delirio Mod adds a brand new character : Delirio.

It comes with its own item : Delirio's Curse.

The character concept is all about his item. It is a 6 charges active item. When you have it, you can't remove it anymore and if you let it go to full charge it will damage you every room. When used, you will turn into one of the other characters. You need at least 2 charges to use it.

## TODO-List:

### Bug fixes:

- Bugfix life when switching characters.

### Item updates:

- Put the item behind unlock conditions.
- Add the properties of the character you currently have in the item. (e. g. if you are Isaac you use the D6 and switch character when you use the item)
- Make it so when you pick the item up with another character you can't switch active item anymore.

### Character updates:

- Put the character behind unlock conditions.
- Make the tainted version.
